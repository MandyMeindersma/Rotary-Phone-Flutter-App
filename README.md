# Rotary Phone Flutter App

An app that will call the number that I have dialed from an old Rotary phone. It makes a call to my [Back End](https://repl.it/@MandyMeindersma/Rotary-Phone) which has the number saved and then calls that number. I have photos and a description of this project on my [personal website](https://www.mandymeindersma.com/).
